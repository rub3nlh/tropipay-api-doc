# Getting Started

### Introduction

Welcome to the Tropipay Business Open API! Here you will find all the information to get started with our API. We're building a future beyond banking and payments, we're excited to have you onboard.

You can use the Business API to automate your own business financial operations. This means you will be able to only access your own Tropipay account.


### Usage and limits

In order to ensure safe and fair resource sharing, we define the following usage limits:

- Maximum 60 requests per minute for a given business


### Demo account

In order to make it easier for you to start working with the API, we've created a sandbox: a test account that replicates the same functionalities as a real business account, but with fake data. This means you don't need to open a business account to start using the API and, more importantly, you won't risk accidentally transferring real money to the wrong person.
