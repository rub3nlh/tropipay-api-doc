## Integration

The TropiPay API supports integration based on the OAuth 2 standard. 

## Protocol Flow

```plain
.        +--------+                               +---------------+
         |        |--(A)- Authorization Request ->|   Resource    |
         |        |                               |     Owner     |

         |        |                               +---------------+
         |        |--(C)-- Authorization Grant -->| Authorization |
         | Client |                               |     Server    |

         |        |                               +---------------+
         |        |
         |        |                               +---------------+

         +--------+                               +---------------+

```
Figure 1: Abstract Protocol Flow

An OAuth 2.0 flow has the following roles:

-   **Resource Owner:** Entity that can grant access to a protected resource. Typically, this is the end-user.
-   **Resource Server:** Server hosting the protected resources. This is the API you want to access.
-   **Client:** Application requesting access to a protected resource on behalf of the Resource Owner.
-   **Authorization Server:** Server that authenticates the Resource Owner and issues access tokens after getting proper authorization. In this case, Auth0.

## OAuth Grant Types

The OAuth framework specifies several grant types for different use cases, as well as a framework for creating new grant types. The most common OAuth grant types used in TropiPay are listed below:

-   **1. Client Credentials:** for External App to TropiPay integration. 
-   **2. Authorization Code with PKCE:** for External App to TropiPay User integration.
-   **3. Refresh Token**

## 1. Client Credentials

Client Credentials is the appropriate flow when you need to integrate an external application with the TropiPay platform, it is what is known in other contexts as _backend-to-backend_ or _machine-to-machine (M2M)_ integration. The Client Credentials grant type is used by clients to obtain an access token outside of the context of a user. This is typically used by clients to access resources about themselves rather than to access a user's resources.

### 1.1 Introduction

One way to verify tokens you receive to your API service is to forward the token to the OAuth server to ask if it is valid. The downside to this method is each API request sent to your server requires a request sent to the OAuth server as well, which increases the time it takes for you to respond to your client. An alternative is to use something called local validation, a strategy popularized by JSON Web Tokens (JWT). A JWT contains your claims (client data) in unencrypted, machine-readable JSON.

How is that secure? you might be wondering. JWTs contain three parts: a header, a payload, and a signature. The header and payload are simple base64 encoded strings, which can easily be decrypted and read. The signature uses an algorithm listed in the header, along with a private key, to create a hash of the header and payload. The hash can’t be recreated without the private key, but it can be verified with a public key. 
In a way, this is like a driver’s license or a passport. It’s quite difficult to forge, but it’s very easy for somebody to look at it and see your name, date of birth, and other information. You can scan the barcode, test it with a black light, or look for watermarks to help verify its validity.

While similar in concept, a valid JWT would actually be far more difficult to forge. Someone with enough skill can create a convincing driver’s license, but without the private key it could take a modern computer years to brute force a valid JWT signature. Tokens should also have an expiration. While configurable, a solid default is one hour. This means a client would need to request a new token every 60 minutes if it needs to make a new request to your API server. This is an extra layer of security in case your token is compromised. Who knows? Maybe there’s a quantum computer out there that can recreate the signature within a couple hours.

### 1.2 Flow

Instead of storing and managing API keys for your clients (other servers), you can use a third-party service to manage authorization for you. The way this works is that an API client sends a request to an OAuth server asking for an API token. That token is then sent from the API client to your API service along with their request. Once you have the client’s token, you can verify its validity without needing to store any information about the client.

```plain
.        +--------+                               +---------------+
         |        |--(A)-- Authorization Grant -->| Authorization |
         |        |                               |     Server    |
         |        |<-(B)----- Access Token -------|               |
         |        |                               +---------------+
         | Client |
         |        |                               +---------------+
         |        |--(C)----- Access Token ------>|    Resource   |
         |        |                               |     Server    |
         |        |<-(D)--- Protected Resource ---|               |
         +--------+                               +---------------+

```
-   **A)** Your app authenticates with the Auth0 Authorization Server using its Client ID (_like username for your app_) and Client Secret (_like password for your app_).
-   **B)** TropiPay Authorization Server validates the Client ID and Client Secret, and  responds with an Access Token.
-   **C)** Your application can use the Access Token to call an API on behalf of itself.
-   **D)** The API responds with requested data.

### 1.3 Example

Now that you understand the basics of the OAuth 2.0 client credentials flow works, let’s create a complete example that contemplates the entire flow.

**1.3.1.** Create a credential in your TropiPay account if you do not have any previously, this would be from the TropiPay dashboard security section or from the API. For more information see [this section](/reference/Tropipay-API.v2.yaml/paths/~1credential/post)

To create a credential, just make a POST request to the _/api/v2/credential_ endpoint specifying a few parameters, as shown in the example below: 
```plain
  POST https://www.tropipay.com/api/v2/credential

  HEADER Authorization Bearer {USER-TOKEN}

> Notice how the response returns an object with the **username** and **password** properties equivalent to **Client_Id** and **Client_Secret** respectively.

**1.3.2.** It is strongly recommended that you store your credential data preferably in environment variables so that they are not exposed from the source code.

    # Environment File <==> .env
    TROPIPAY_CLIENT_ID={response.data.username}
    TROPIPAY_CLIENT_SECRET={response.data.password}

**1.3.3.** Access endpoint with POST _/api/v2/access/token_ to request your access token, specifying the Client_Id and the Client_Secret. For more information see [this section](/reference/Tropipay-API.v2.yaml/paths/~1access~1token/post) 

Index.js with source code:

```js
const axios = require('axios').default;
axios({
  method: 'post',
  url: 'https://www.tropipay.com/api/v2/access/token',
  data: {
    "grant_type":"client_credentials",

```

**1.3.4.** Once the access token has been obtained, it will be able to consume the resources allowed for the credential. For example let's see how to consume  [credential/grant/list](/reference/Tropipay-API.v2.yaml/paths/~1credential~1grant~1list/post) using your new access token, this service returns the list of available permissions:

## 2. Authorization Code
The Authorization Code Grant Type is probably the most common of the OAuth 2.0 grant types that you’ll encounter. It is used by both web apps and native apps to get an access token after a user authorizes an app. 

### 2.1 Introduction

The authorization code grant is used when an application exchanges an authorization code for an access token. After the user returns to the application via the redirect URL, the application will get the authorization code from the URL and use it to request an access token. This request will be made to the token endpoint.

The Authorization Code flow is best used in web and mobile apps. Since the Authorization Code grant has the extra step of exchanging the authorization code for the access token, it provides an additional layer of security not present in the Implicit grant type.

If you’re using the Authorization Code flow in a mobile app, or any other type of application that can’t store a client secret, then you should also use the PKCE extension, which provides protections against other attacks where the authorization code may be intercepted.

The code exchange step ensures that an attacker isn’t able to intercept the access token, since the access token is always sent via a secure backchannel between the application and the OAuth server.

### 2.2 Flow

The Authorization Code grant type is used by web and mobile apps. It differs from most of the other grant types by first requiring the app launch a browser to begin the flow. At a high level, the flow has the following steps:

```plain                                                             
.                                                +-------------------+
                                                 |   Auth  Server    |
       +--------+                                | +---------------+ |
       |        |--(A)- Authorization Request ---->|               | |
       |        |       + t(code_verifier), t_m  | | Authorization | |
       |        |                                | |    Endpoint   | |
       |        |<-(B)---- Authorization Code -----|               | |
       |        |                                | +---------------+ |
       | Client |                                |                   |
       |        |                                | +---------------+ |
       |        |--(C)-- Access Token Request ---->|               | |
       |        |          + code_verifier       | |    Token      | |
       |        |                                | |   Endpoint    | |
       |        |<-(D)------ Access Token ---------|               | |
       +--------+                                | +---------------+ |
                                                 +-------------------+
```

- The application opens a browser to send the user to the OAuth server
- The user sees the authorization prompt and approves the app’s request
- The user is redirected back to the application with an authorization code in the query string
- The application exchanges the authorization code for an access token


### 2.3 Get the User’s Permission
OAuth is all about enabling users to grant limited access to applications. The application first needs to decide which permissions it is requesting, then send the user to a browser to get their permission. To begin the authorization flow, the application constructs a URL like the following and opens a browser to that URL.

```plain
https://tropipay-dev.herokuapp.com/api/v2/access/authorize
      ?response_type=code
      &client_id=1b125cefa4e6aa5fc044a06190953eac
      &redirect_uri=https//my-app.com/auth/callback
      &scope=ALLOW_GET_BALANCE
      &state=xcoiv98y2kd22vusuye3kch
```

Here’s each query parameter explained:

- **response_type=code**: This tells the authorization server that the application is initiating the authorization code flow.
- **client_id**: The public identifier for the application, obtained when the developer first registered the application- .
- **redirect_uri**: Tells the authorization server where to send the user back to after they approve the request- .
- **scope**: One or more space-separated strings indicating which permissions the application is requesting. The specific OAuth API you’re using will define the scopes that it supports.
- **state**: The application generates a random string and includes it in the request. It should then check that the same value is returned after the user authorizes the app. This is used to prevent CSRF attacks.

When the user visits this URL, the authorization server will present them with a prompt asking if they would like to authorize this application’s request.

### 2.4 Redirect Back to the Application

If the user approves the request, the authorization server will redirect the browser back to the redirect_uri specified by the application, adding a code and state to the query string. For example, the user will be redirected back to a URL such as:

```plain
https//my-app.com/auth/callback?code=g0ZGZmNjVmOWIjNTk2NTk4ZTYyZGI3&state=xcoiv98y2kd22vusuye3kch
```

The state value will be the same value that the application initially set in the request. The application is expected to check that the state in the redirect matches the state it originally set. This protects against CSRF and other related attacks.

The code is the authorization code generated by the authorization server. This code is relatively short-lived, typically lasting between 1 to 10 minutes depending on the OAuth service.

### 2.5 Exchange the Authorization Code for an Access Token
We’re about ready to wrap up the flow. Now that the application has the authorization code, it can use that to get an access token. The application makes a POST request to the service’s token endpoint with the following parameters:

- **grant_type=authorization_code**: This tells the token endpoint that the application is using the Authorization Code grant type.
- **code**: The application includes the authorization code it was given in the redirect.
- **redirect_uri**: The same redirect URI that was used when requesting the code. Some APIs don’t require this parameter, so you’ll need to double check the documentation of the particular API you’re accessing.
- **client_id**: The application’s client ID.
- **client_secret**: The application’s client secret. This ensures that the request to get the access token is made only from the application, and not from a potential attacker that may have intercepted the authorization code.

The token endpoint will verify all the parameters in the request, ensuring the code hasn’t expired and that the client ID and secret match. If everything checks out, it will generate an access token and return it in the response!

```plain
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Cache-Control: no-store
Pragma: no-cache

{
  "access_token":"MTQ0NjJkZmQ5OTM2NDE1ZTZjNGZmZjI3",
  "token_type":"bearer",
  "expires_in":3600,
  "refresh_token":"IwOGYzYTlmM2YxOTQ5MGE3YmNmMDFkNTVk",
  "scope":"ALLOW_GET_BALANCE"
}
```

The Authorization Code flow is complete! The application now has an access token it can use when making API requests.

### 2.6 PKCE extension

The Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE, pronounced pixie) extension describes a technique for public clients to mitigate the threat of having the authorization code intercepted. The technique involves the client first creating a secret, and then using that secret again when exchanging the authorization code for an access token. This way if the code is intercepted, it will not be useful since the token request relies on the initial secret. The full spec is available as [RFC7636](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7636).


## 3. Refresh Token
The Refresh Token grant type is used by clients to exchange a refresh token for an access token when the access token has expired. This allows clients to continue to have a valid access token without further interaction with the user.

### 3.1 Introduction

This section describes how to allow your developers to use refresh tokens to obtain new access tokens. If your service issues refresh tokens along with the access token, then you’ll need to implement the Refresh grant type described here.

### 3.1 Flow

Refresh tokens are credentials used to obtain access tokens.  Refresh tokens are issued to the client by the authorization server and are used to obtain a new access token when the current access token becomes invalid or expires or to obtain additional access tokens with identical or narrower scope (access tokens may have a shorter lifetime and fewer permissions than authorized by the resource owner).  Issuing a refresh token is optional at the discretion of the authorization server. If the authorization server issues a refresh token, it is included when issuing an access token.

```

A refresh token is a string representing the authorization granted to the client by the resource owner.  The string is usually opaque to the client.  The token denotes an identifier used to retrieve the authorization information.  Unlike access tokens, refresh tokens are intended for use only with authorization servers and are never sent to resource servers.

The flow illustrated in Figure 2 includes the following steps:

- **A:** The client requests an access token by authenticating with the authorization server and presenting an authorization grant.

- **B:** The authorization server authenticates the client and validates the authorization grant, and if valid, issues an access token and a refresh token.

- **C:** The client makes a protected resource request to the resource server by presenting the access token.

- **D:** The resource server validates the access token, and if valid, serves the request.

- **E:** Steps (C) and (D) repeat until the access token expires. If the client knows the access token expired, it skips to step (G); otherwise, it makes another protected resource request.

- **F:** Since the access token is invalid, the resource server returns an invalid token error.

- **G:** The client requests a new access token by authenticating with the authorization server and presenting the refresh token. The client authentication requirements are based on the client type and on the authorization server policies.

- **H:** The authorization server authenticates the client and validates the refresh token, and if valid, issues a new access token (and, optionally, a new refresh token).
