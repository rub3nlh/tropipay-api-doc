# Refresh Token
The Refresh Token grant type is used by clients to exchange a refresh token for an access token when the access token has expired. This allows clients to continue to have a valid access token without further interaction with the user.

### How it works

This section describes how to allow your developers to use refresh tokens to obtain new access tokens. If your service issues refresh tokens along with the access token, then youâ€™ll need to implement the Refresh grant type described here.

### Flow

Refresh tokens are credentials used to obtain access tokens.  Refresh tokens are issued to the client by the authorization server and are used to obtain a new access token when the current access token becomes invalid or expires or to obtain additional access tokens with identical or narrower scope (access tokens may have a shorter lifetime and fewer permissions than authorized by the resource owner).  Issuing a refresh token is optional at the discretion of the authorization server. If the authorization server issues a refresh token, it is included when issuing an access token.

```

A refresh token is a string representing the authorization granted to the client by the resource owner.  The string is usually opaque to the client.  The token denotes an identifier used to retrieve the authorization information.  Unlike access tokens, refresh tokens are intended for use only with authorization servers and are never sent to resource servers.

The flow illustrated in Figure 2 includes the following steps:

- **A:** The client requests an access token by authenticating with the authorization server and presenting an authorization grant.

- **B:** The authorization server authenticates the client and validates the authorization grant, and if valid, issues an access token and a refresh token.

- **C:** The client makes a protected resource request to the resource server by presenting the access token.

- **D:** The resource server validates the access token, and if valid, serves the request.

- **E:** Steps (C) and (D) repeat until the access token expires. If the client knows the access token expired, it skips to step (G); otherwise, it makes another protected resource request.

- **F:** Since the access token is invalid, the resource server returns an invalid token error.

- **G:** The client requests a new access token by authenticating with the authorization server and presenting the refresh token. The client authentication requirements are based on the client type and on the authorization server policies.

- **H:** The authorization server authenticates the client and validates the refresh token, and if valid, issues a new access token (and, optionally, a new refresh token).
